Number of tasks N and number of processors S:
N S
Matrix of tasks duration for processors {C_ij}:
C_11 C_12 ... C_1N
...
C_S1 C_S2 ... C_SN
Matrix of times for transmition between processors {D_ij}:
D_11 D12 ... D_1S
...
D_S1 D_S2 ... D_SS
Graph of dependencies of tasks G in matrix view - a_ij = 0 if there's an arc, a_ij = 0 else:
G_11 G_12 ... G_1N
...
G_N1 G_N2 ... G_NN


Note: In program all numerations starts with 0
